DESCRIPTION 
---

RECtivechain is a decentralized platform for the registration and distribution of content that certifies the authorship and license of any work or creation making them indelible.
A tool for the empowerment of artists and all kinds of creative people who produce, share and distribute digital content.
The platform applies the power of attorney of the revolutionary Blockchain technology in the process of registering content to create incorruptible time stamps that certify the intellectual property of any digital work.
RECtivechain incorporates all the advantages derived from the innovation of crypto coins. In this way, without the need to use bank accounts, purchases, micropayments or donations can be made to the authors of the registered contents.
For the platform, creative chains are the ability of art and culture to interweave any kind of intellectual creation. When it is decided to use a copyleft licensed image to complete a new work of art, an invisible link is created that unites these two works forever. In that sense, the platform has been designed to strengthen the relationships that are generated in the processes of collective creation, therefore, any payment or donation can be chained to reward with a percentage to all the authors that are aligned in a creative chain.

When someone makes a payment to a work, a percentage is distributed to the entire chain of works that follow. In this way the payment or donation is extended in an "automagic" way to all the derivative works that have participated giving away part of its content.

If the innovative blockchain technology is used in Bitcoin to certify monetary transactions, in RECtivechain it is used to certify content registrations (distribution licenses, smart contracts, metadata or files). This technological adaptation makes it possible for the first time in history to create a content distribution system that is decentralized, public, transparent, traceable, incorruptible and free code.

RECtivechain is a bet for the public benefit of free culture and common creation as a collaborative method of growing and guaranteeing the right to culture.

CHARACTERISTICS
---
Registration of intellectual property
---

Problem: Any digital content is very easy to copy and distribute. This feature often makes it very difficult to prove the authenticity, authorship or distribution license of any original creation. Currently even if a certain work is announced, tagged or linked with a RECtive Commons license does not mean that it is sealed under a power of attorney. In a rights dispute this can be an inconvenience to the author when it comes to demonstrating his authorship.

Solution: RECtivechain uses blockchain technology and its power of attorney to solve this problem by creating an incorruptible and inalterable time stamp that allows to certify the authorship and license of use or distribution of any work or digital creation. In this way the platform becomes a kind of book of public records that can be consulted and verified by anyone at all times. Texts, images, videos, songs ... can be protected allowing the original creator to be recognized in the event of a conflict of license infringement by a third party.

Notary registration of licenses
---

Problem: Since the creation of RECtive Commons licenses in 2002 to date, the use of these licenses in works has grown to more than 1100 million in 2015. This increase makes many creators receive situations of non-compliance of their license by third parties or companies. Almost always these conflicts end up being forgotten by the independent author. The most common causes that push the author to not complain usually is not being able to demonstrate the authorship of their work, the legal ignorance or the lack of money to pay the legal costs that would entail claiming their rights.

Solution: RECtivechain offers a very simple and economical solution to empower the authors when claiming their rights. On the one hand the platform issues a digital certificate of authenticity that can be sent to the company that is infringing the rights.
At the same time, the platform incorporates an open channel of direct legal advice with specialized copyright lawyers who will be able to guide and manage online the procedures to claim their rights.
The nature of the copyright culture creates a gap in cultural participation.
At RECtivechain we understand that all people have the right to participate in cultural life and enjoy its benefits. That is why we encourage, protect and give priority to the use of free licenses as a means of helping to reduce the cultural participation gap and facilitate the construction of a free culture necessary for the exercise of the right of access to the culture of all societies.

Smart contracts
---
Problem: Traditional methods of transferring copyright are often processes that generate an economic and temporary cost for all parties involved.

Solution: RECtivechain registers content with a system that is capable of issuing "smart contracts" to make work assignment agreements. A smart contract acts as an informatic program that facilitates, secures, enforces and executes agreements between individuals and organizations. These contracts are signed cryptographically between the parties and are intended to provide greater security than traditional contract law and reduce transaction costs along the process of contracting. RECtivechain's smart contracts mean a huge saving of time and money for artists, producers, institutions, organizations or galleries working in the culture sector.
Contracts can be public or encrypted and guarantee that the two parties accept the conditions. With the smart contracts of RECtivechain any person can make sure that the purchaser of the assignment of rights has enough money to be unlocked at the time of the signing and registration.

The RECtivechain platform allows you to incorporate any type of license into a smart contract to seal assignment agreements or to sell and distribute the work in the channels or communities of the platform. Contracts based on methods of distribution that favor collective creation:
Smarts C Commons: Contracts relating to the parties with a RECtive Commons license or copyleft
Royalty Free Stock Photography: Contracts based on agreements of purchase and sale of free licenses for unlimited use in any project and forever.
Equity Crowd: Agreements for the distribution of dividends as participation for project investors. In this way the benefits of distribution of the work are distributed automatically among all the microinverters.
Sponsor License: License to sponsor contents of users who have activated this function in their project.
RECtive Chain License: License based on a RECtive Commons license to string derivative works whose profits are distributed in a chained way with a Percentage X to all mentioned works.

The creator of "smart contracts" that incorporates the platform allows you to design contracts tailored to fit the needs of each cultural sector.
The purchase of works directly supports the creator of the work and its creative chain.

Transparency and traceability of consumption data.
---
Problem: Any content distribution companies like Google, Youtube or Amazon privatize statistics and consumption data. This causes technological giants to have a market monopoly, creating consumer trends and manipulating any sale on their platforms.
Society is increasingly aware of this power and is unwilling to cede its information to large multinationals that offer free services to convert user information into a privatized and marketable value. In most cases this information is sold to third parties to multiply their value, as happens in the advertising use. In this sense we must remember the famous axiom that says; "When something is free, the product is you."

Solution: In RECtivechain, all f interaction and consumption data are public, always respecting author or consumerâ€™s choice of identity and anonymity. Only users can decide to reveal their identity to who they want and even publish their information in an encrypted way. In this way, any user can use the networkâ€™s statistics to improve their content offer on equal terms with other users.
In RECtivechain, the content owners are the authors, and they will always be able to prove it with the records that have been registered in the blockchain.


Distribution of TFS files in network Torrent
---
Problem: Currently digital content distribution companies use private servers where all content is centralized. In this way the content that we upload remains opaque in the hands of intermediaries and their private interests, being able to be manipulated by the lack of transparency. Usually they censure or eliminate contents without prior notice. In most cases, these intermediaries acquire the right to include in both their terms and conditions of use the ownership of the digital archive and the right to exploit it.

Solution: The complete decentralization of all the metadata in a blockchain is the solution to fight against the accumulation of power that some content distribution companies have. 
Tarsius File System (TFS) has been developed to provide a solution to the cloud storage and temporary perpetuity. TFS allows file storage while guarantees the availability of data with 10 copies. The number of copies can be configured by the blockchain system consensus. TFS encrypts the documents and uses the Torrent network as a parasite that ensures the stable permanence of all registered files. 
Although it is always recommended to the user to have the original file as a proof, in case of legal dispute the TFS system works as a backup to rescue the original file while it acts as a method of viewing content from the decentralized platform RECtivechain.
All metadata records that link to the files are stored in the block chain. This way no one can modify a single record as it would not match the information shared by the other nodes and would not be validated. Thanks to this process, we are able to offer a distributed and public registry system whose consensus resides in the code itself and any modification of the initial source code should be approved by more than 51% of the nodes.

RECtivecoin: the crypto currency of RECtive communities.
---
Problem: In many countries, artists and creators are separated from any funding strategy because of the difficulty of accessing a bank account. At the same time, banks act as intermediaries by imposing fees on transactions that end up making very expensive the final cost of production of any work or creation.

Solution: RECtivechain aims to free cultural production from the intermediation of traditional banks and offer new and more inclusive financing services. That is why the platform offers the service of management of collections, payments or donations with RECtivecoin, the first cryptocurrency created  and designed to meet the needs of all creative communities that produce and distribute digital content.
There are many benefits attributed to the use of virtual currencies. A global currency that does not belong to any state or government and can be used around the world without geographical or political barriers. Being foreign to the fiduciary system can not create debt with it and its value does not depend on the intervention of any central bank.
RECtivecoin uses up to 8 decimals divisible. This fact facilitates the micropayments to all type of contents. The transactions are made in real time and their execution is completed in a few minutes. The currency is designed to be impossible to falsify, nor can a double expense be made without the network detecting it. The cryptocurrency is anonymous and no one is obliged to reveal its identity. This makes of RECtivecoin a perfect currency to register contents anonymously.
All transactions and registrations are transparent and are recorded in an open account book. The use of RECtivecoin entails lower costs per transaction than any traditional credit card system or payment gateways such as Paypal. RECtivecoin is a peer-to-peer currency and works like cash, with the advantage that it occupies a tiny space so you can save a huge amount on a small file or a USB stick.

This way, RECtivechain goes one step beyond copyleft by applying "copyfarleft". This means that the platform not only bets on the defense, protection and distribution of copyleft content, but also gives "fintech" solutions for the economic emancipation of People who produce it.

RECtivecoin blockchain has three basic functions: registering content metadata, issuing smart contracts and using a cryptocurrency.
Unlike other currencies, RECtivecoin contemplates a basic value that is to register contents.
The fee is 0.001 REC that is distributed in full to the nodes that have confirmed the transactions.

Peer to Peer Content Distribution
---
The RECtivechain platform adapts to the multiple needs of digital content creators by facilitating various P2P distribution methods for their works.

RECtive Commons
---  
It allows to view and download for free, as long as the creator is respected according to the RECtive Commons Attribution license. In order to encourage the use of free licenses, the platform rewards with RECtivecoin the works licensed with CC that have obtained a better evaluation by the community.
The author can introduce a work with copyright license and set a total price for his work. 
Once the money has been obtained thanks to the donations or micropayments of other users, the intelligent contract unlocks the work and issues a new copyleft license that liberates the work for the whole community.

Royalty Free
---
Purchase and sale of Royalty-Free licenses for unlimited use on any project and forever. Purchases directly support the creator of the work.

Equity Crowdfunding
---
The creator of the work offers a percentage of participation for investors. This way the benefits of distribution of the work are distributed automatically among all the microinverters.

Donations
---
The platform allows to make donations in Bitcoin and RECtivecoin for all the works registered in RECtivechainâ€™s blockchain.

Limited Edition
---
RECtors can distribute their creations in limited edition mode. This means that creators can limit the broadcast of a digital artwork and sell a limited number of reproductions that are certified and numbered.

RECtive Chains
---
We understand "creative chains" as the ability of art and culture to interweave any kind of intellectual creation. When a creator decides to use a copyleft licensed image to complete a new artwork generates an invisible link that links these two works forever.
Thanks to blockchain technology we can now record, trace and visualize in a decentralized public archive all the connections that are generated between any creation.
This system facilitates the chaining of payments to derivative works, giving an innovative solution to the recognition and economic reward of the creative chains.
This characteristic is the one that gives name to the platform and its final objective is to be able to create a map of connections that help us to understand how the cultural transmission is articulated and the creative processes that shape it over time.

RECtion of Dapps
---
RECtivechain is an open source ecosystem that allows other content platforms to create their own decentralized applications that use the RECtivecoin blockchain to store and index content. These platforms can be specialized in Art, photography, videos, ebooks, software, music, multimedia banks ... any distribution system is possible.

Social Network
---
RECtivechain works like any social network where content is displayed or distributed. You can create distribution channels and specific communities where interact with content from other authors, using, rating and commenting on their creations. The system incorporates an encrypted chat so that you can contact privately with the artists and authors of the content.

Development Process
-------------------

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #creativecoin #creativechain.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
